I build and invest in technology startups.

I was a Director at [Coinbase](http://www.coinbase.com/){:target="_blank"} where I built product and engineering teams for four years. Before that, I founded [SoundFocus](https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/14/yc-backed-soundfocus-launches-with-an-app-for-2020-hearing-with-mysterious-hardware-on-the-way/){:target="_blank"} to help people with hearing loss, and worked at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}. I grew up in India and studied at Carnegie Mellon University.
