The older I get, the more I think about my health. I want to live long and in good health, as I presume most of us do. But how do you maximize the odds of that happening?

It's surprising how little time schools spend on this. Popular media has a long list of ideas: avoid gluten, go vegan, fast often, take omega3 pills, eat less red meat and more fish, avoid alcohol, drink red wine and eat colorful vegetables. These articles are faddish and cite studies with small samples or contradicting research. They're also more vested in increasing their readership than your longevity.

I searched through papers and books on the topics of mortality and life expectancy. I looked for meta-analyses, studies with large samples, recent papers and contradictory research. I also learned that some things are harder to sample and test. Finding the impact of meat-eating on mortality should be easy since we have lots of vegetarians and meat-eaters. But the impact of carrot-eating on mortality is harder since we don't have large populations of carrot eaters and carrot abstainers.

So I prioritized finding simple habits in knowable areas that would improve longevity:

**1. Lift weights and run for an hour every other day** \
Moderate exercise like brisk walking for 2.5 hours a week [significantly reduces the risk](https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/paguide.pdf){:target="_blank"} of early death, coronary disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, colon cancer and depression. Lifting weights *and* running further [reduces coronary risk and premature death](https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005768-201903000-00014){:target="_blank"}.

**2. Eat as many vegetables as you can and watch your weight** \
Eating up to 800g of fruits and vegetables every day [reduces](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/3/1029/3039477){:target="_blank"}  cardiovascular disease, mortality rates and cancer. We don't know which specific vegetables are good for you, so eat them all. Your BMI and waist size [has a strong relationship](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4115619/){:target="_blank"} with mortality, so keep your weight in check.

**3. Don't eat processed meats** \
Processed meats like bacon and ham [increase the risks of colon cancer](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2815%2900444-1/fulltext){:target="_blank"}. Nitrate salts and high-temperature charring are the carcinogenic culprits. Surprisingly, there's no conclusive evidence showing that meat is bad for you. Some studies on red meat [show an impact on mortality](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-0699){:target="_blank"}, while [others do not](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-0699){:target="_blank"}. With fish, studies show high and low fish consumption having [no effect on mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4356893/){:target="_blank"}.

**5. Sleep for 8 hours every night at the same time** \
Sufficient sleep leads to better learning, memory and cognitive performance. But it turns out that the actual amount varies from 6-8 hours depending on the person. Even more confoundingly, too much sleep and too little sleep are both [shown to increase mortality](https://perma.cc/MK7U-EDV4){:target="_blank"}. Improve sleep by going to bed at the same time every night in a cool dark room. Avoid caffeine and naps for 8 hours before bedtime. Also skip  alcohol in the evenings, late-night meals and LED screens before bed.

**6. Meditate for half an hour every day.**\
Intensive meditation for just two months [changes the structure of the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4203679/){:target="_blank"}. This isn't a good thing in and of itself but shows that meditation has measurable physical effects. Self-reported markers for anxiety, stress and depression [decrease with regular mindfulness exercises](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4142584/){:target="_blank"}.
