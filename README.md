## :package: Installing Dependencies

First, ensure that the following are installed globally on your machine:

- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- [Ruby 3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

You can use the [jekyll guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to get this working on yoru setup. Then run `bundle install` to install all dependencies. 

## :racehorse: Running the App

You can start the server with `bundle exec jekyll serve` which should make the website available on localhost:4000

## :rocket: Deploying

Whenever a PR merges into master, netlify ensures that it's automatically deployed to varunsrinivasan.com
